# Ideapad-Y700-Opencore
This is my opencore configuration for the Lenovo Ideapad Y700-15ISK.  

Please Note: I have moved onto another laptop, so this repo is mainly for archival purposes and will updated sparingly/never updated.  

I have only tested this configuration up to Big Sur 11.2.1. Nearly everything is working.  

What is working:  

Trackpad w/ gesture support. 

All USB ports. 

HDMI port - video and audio. 

Battery status. 

Stock wifi nic. 

Ethernet nic. 

Camera  

I have not tested the mic. 

What is not working:  

Nvidia graphics - will never be supported, and is disabled in this config. 

SD card reader - I have heard people having success with the SD interface, I attempted to get it working briefly with little success; and as I rarely use the SD reader, I decided it wasn't worth the effort.
